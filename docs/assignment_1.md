# Assignment 1, Fansite

## Context

This is the 1st assignment for the first semester coding course in the graphic design department at KABK, lead by James Bryan Graves.

## Description

"A fansite, fan site, fan blog or fan page is a website created and maintained by a fan or devotee about a celebrity, thing, or particular cultural phenomenon."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansite

You will create a website *from scratch*, using no authoring tooling or CMS, over the course of the entirety of the first semester with one additional HTML, CSS or Javascript "feature" every week.

A feature: "A distinguishing characteristic of a software item (e.g., performance, portability, or functionality)."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software\_feature

Examples: Animation (rotation, scaling, etc.), sound, hover states, click/tap user interaction, video, menus, etc..

Each week the new features and content will be committed to blackbox.pubkey.space, using Git.

Do not be shy about taking this pseudo-seriously.  Frame the features and content in an identity (voice, design, logos, typography, etc.) of your own creation.

## Assessment

Please commit a new feature described in a git commit message (we will learn about git in class) by Friday evening everyi week.  This should be a minium 1 - 2 hour a week time requirement.

Please commit a new piece of content along with the feature.  Content can be copy, image(s), links with desciption, etc..

Please do NOT use jQuery.  Only native browser functionality will be accepted.

## Learning objective

You will have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Examples

These are VERY boring examples.
