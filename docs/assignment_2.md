# Assignment 2, Presence and population 

## Context

This is the assignment for the second semester coding course in the graphic design department at KABK, lead by James Bryan Graves.

## Description

The goal of this assignment is to show both the presence of the user in a digital context, as well as all the other users who are or have participated as well in the experience.  The requires the persistence of data across internet and time.

As a reference I recommend: http://donottouch.org/, which records the users mouse cursor position, while also showing the position of the cursors of other users.

## Assessment

Students will be assessed on 2 points.

* Showing the presence of the user.

* Showing the population of all users currently in the experience, and/or users across time and space.

## Learning objective

The recommended implementation here is a client/server architecture where the client embodies the experience, while the server facilitates the data storage and retrieve mechanisms to show population.  However, the implementation is up the students if the assessment criteria is fulfilled.

It is also suggested this assignment is combined with the IMD class, which provides a implemenation context for the client.
